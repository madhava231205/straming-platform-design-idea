Click on above link to view the design model</br>
firstly I am new to the UI/UX design field and i am interested to design</br>
So, while i am watching movies on my freetime i get attracted for the design of streaming platform so my interest in designing bring a crazy idea in my mind</br>
so as a beginner for figma i learnt some basics through YouTube tutorials and i redesign the streaming platform</br>
In this experience, where the thoughts went from mind to paper and  to figma, then finally i learnt new skills and improve the creative thinking.</br>
In this design model- </br>
I  make the streamX homepage where movies images are displayed, i also design the separate page for each movie where it shows the similar movies, sidebar. </br>
I also design the watchlist and favourites page for the platform</br>
finally from rough sketches to presentation, i completed it with formal looks and decent design
